Programming Language Used
The problems in this repository are solved using:
[Java]

Problem Solutions
Each problem's solution is located in a separate file as per the instructions.

Problem-1: [Goal: Create a calculator that takes two numbers and a type of operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

Concepts Used: Class, constructor, method, switch-case.

Key Idea: Perform basic arithmetic operations using encapsulated logic in a Calculator class.]

File: Problem-1.[java] 

Problem-2: [Goal: Take an integer a and generate the first a odd numbers starting from 1.

Example: If a = 4, output is 1, 3, 5, 7.

Key Idea: Use a loop to generate odd numbers using the formula 2*i + 1.]

File: Problem-2.[java]

Problem-3: [Goal: Print all odd numbers from 1 up to the given number a (or a - 1 if a is even).

Example: If a = 6, output is 1, 3, 5.

Key Idea: Loop through numbers from 1 to a, and print only those that are odd.

File: Problem-3.[java]

Problem-4: [Goal: Given a list of integers, count how many numbers are divisible by each of the digits from 1 to 9.

Example: Input [1,2,8,9,12,...], output like {1: 11, 2: 8, ..., 9: 1}.

Key Idea: Use a map/dictionary to track how many elements in the list are divisible by 1 to 9]

File: Problem-4.[java]

Important Note
As per the test instructions, these problems were solved independently without the use of any external assistance through the internet.
